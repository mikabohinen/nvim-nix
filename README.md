# nvim-nix

An opinionated, minimalist, and distraction free Neovim environment that just works.

## Features

- ðŸ”§ **Minimal**: Only 8 plugins for maximum performance and focus
- âš¡ **Just Works**: Reproducible setup with zero configuration on any machine with Nix

## Quick Start

```bash
# Try it immediately (full development environment)
nix run github:mikabohinen/nvim-nix#dev

# Just the editor (minimal)
nix run github:mikabohinen/nvim-nix#neovim

# Development shell with all tools
nix develop github:mikabohinen/nvim-nix
```

## Installation

### Home Manager

Add to your `home.nix`:

```nix
{
  inputs.nvim-nix.url = "github:mikabohinen/nvim-nix";

  # In your home configuration:
  imports = [ inputs.nvim-nix.homeManagerModules.default ];

  programs.nvimNix = {
    enable = true;
    enableDevTools = true; # Install formatters, linters, etc.
  };
}
```

### NixOS System-wide

Add to your `configuration.nix`:

```nix
{
  inputs.nvim-nix.url = "github:mikabohinen/nvim-nix";

  # In your system configuration:
  imports = [ inputs.nvim-nix.nixosModules.default ];

  programs.nvimNix = {
    enable = true;
    defaultEditor = true;
    enableDevTools = true;
  };
}
```

### Package Variants

- **`#neovim`**: Minimal editor with LSP support only
- **`#default`**: Full editor with all development tools
- **`#dev`**: App launcher with proper PATH for all tools
- **`#dev-tools`**: Just the development tools (formatters, linters, etc.)

## Philosophy

It is our opinion that mastery is more important in the long run than short
term productivity and convenience. We therefore follow a minimalist approach
with only the most essential plugins that build upon the philosophy of Vim itself.
This minimalism builds upon a set of core principles:

1. **Vim-first**: Given that Vim has remained highly relevant for over 30 years
   one must conclude that Vim has touched upon something more fundamental than
   just the technology itself. Modern plugins and enhancements should therefore
   build upon this and not replace it with tools that hide away these
   fundamentals. This is why we prefer builtin tools like `:grep` or `:find`
   compared to their modern counterparts. On the other hand, LSP and Treesitter
   hook into these fundamentals to extend the capabilities of Vim itself.

2. **Reproducibility**: Modern tooling and environments grow increasingly
   complex day by day. This complexity isn't inherently bad as long as we can
   understand it. However, in a world where "works on my machine" is a common
   phrase it is valuable to have an environment in which you can be productive
   no matter where you are. You should be able to work with the same efficiency
   whether you are on your laptop, a server, a VM, or anywhere else. To achieve
   this we need a declarative configuration and not a set of imperative
   commands that you type into your terminal like a set of enchantments while
   you pray to the powers that be that everything works. Nix solves this by
   giving us absolute control over the dependency chain and environment state.

3. **Compositionality**: The power of Unix tools like `cd`, `ls`, `grep`,
   `awk`, etc., is their ability to be composed with each other through piping.
   We believe that this principle should be applied to the extensions we make
   to Vim itself. Every addition should be able to be composed with each other
   in a predictable way. In this way we can build increasingly complex
   workflows while still having a good understanding of what is happening at
   the more granular level.

These principles inform our choice of plugins.


## Plugin List

See [selection criteria](#Plugin-selection-criteria) for the exact details of why these specific plugins are acceptable.

**Modern Necessities** (what vimscript can't handle well):

- **nvim-lspconfig**: Language server integration
- **nvim-treesitter + textobjects**: Enhanced syntax and structural navigation

**Editing** (amplify core Vim strengths):

- **vim-surround**: Text object manipulation
- **vim-repeat**: Quality of life addition
- **vim-vinegar**: Enhanced netrw

**Development Integration** (essential workflow tools):

- **vim-fugitive**: Git integration

**Lisp Exception** (structural editing for uniform syntax):

- **vim-sexp**: Paredit-style editing for s-expressions

**Total: 8 plugins** - 5 local (absolute control) + 3 nixpkgs (complex builds)

### Plugin Management

Pure Nix declarative plugin management replaces traditional plugin managers.

#### Local Plugins (5) - Managed via `plugins.nix`
```nix
# Declarative plugin definitions with exact version control
vim-surround = {
  owner = "tpope";
  repo = "vim-surround";
  rev = "3d188ed2113431cf8dac77be61b842acb64433d9";  # Exact commit
  sha256 = "sha256-abc123...";                       # Cryptographic integrity
};
```

#### Nixpkgs Plugins (3) - Managed via `default.nix`
Complex plugins that benefit from Nix's build system: nvim-lspconfig, nvim-treesitter, nvim-treesitter-textobjects.

#### Plugin Commands
```bash
# List all plugins with breakdown
nix run .#plugins list

# Show plugin statistics
nix run .#plugins stats

# Check for updates
nix run .#plugins check-updates

# Plugin management environment
nix develop .#plugins
```

### Plugin selection criteria

We exclude a plugin if it does one or more of these things:

1. Hides complexity you should understand
2. Replaces learning with convenience
3. Creates dependencies on specific abstractions
4. Violates Vim patterns
5. Provides convenience over capability

If a plugin doesn't violate any of the above then we will consider
it if and only if it also satisfies the following criteria:

1. Makes you a better developer
2. Provides capabilities Vim doesn't natively have
3. Builds upon Vim's philosophy
4. Reinforces good practices


#### Examples of excluded plugins

- **Fuzzy finders**: :find \*\*/\* is sufficient, and using :grep together with the quickfix list is better
- **Auto-formatters**: :!black % teaches you more
- **Visual git tools**: command-line git + fugitive forces you to grok git
- **Comment automation**: manual commenting teaches language syntax
- **Session managers**: :mksession covers 80% of use cases

## Supported Languages

Each language includes appropriate tooling based on ecosystem maturity:

- **Bash** - LSP (bashls), treesitter, formatter (shfmt)
- **Haskell** - LSP (hls), treesitter, formatter (fourmolu)
- **Java** - LSP (jdtls), treesitter, formatter (google-java-format)
- **Common Lisp** - treesitter, structural editing
- **Markdown** - treesitter, formatter (prettier)
- **Nix** - LSP (nixd), treesitter, formatter (nixpkgs-fmt)
- **LaTeX** - LSP (texlab), treesitter
- **Lua** - treesitter, formatter (stylua)
- **Python** - LSP (pyright), treesitter, formatter (black)

## Key Bindings

### Philosophy: Consistent Patterns

Key bindings follow functional grouping:

- **`<leader>f*`**: All "finding" operations (files, buffers, search)
- **`<leader>g*`**: Git operations
- **`<leader>c*`**: Code operations (LSP, diagnostics, formatting)
- **`<leader>cd*`**: Code diagnostic operations
- **`<leader>n*`**: Nix development workflow
- **`<leader>w*`**: Workspace management (LSP)
- **Navigation**: Native vim patterns (`]b`, `[q`, etc.)

### Core Finding Operations

**Leader key**: `<Space>` for global operations
**Local leader**: `,` for filetype-specific operations

```vim
" File finding (vim native)
<leader><leader>  " :find *
<leader>ff        " :find * (same as above)
<leader>fF        " :find **/* (recursive)

" Buffer operations
<leader>fb       " :buffer * (find and open)
<leader>fB       " :sbuffer * (find and split)
[b / ]b          " Previous/next buffer
<leader>bd       " Delete buffer

" Search operations
<leader>fw       " :grep "" . (project-wide search)
<leader>fW       " :vimgrep // **/* (vim's internal search)
<leader>fs       " :lgrep "" . (location list search)
<leader>fS       " :lvimgrep // **/* (location list vim search)
```

### Navigation & Lists

```vim
" Quickfix & Location Lists
<leader>q / <leader>Q   " Open/close quickfix
<leader>l / <leader>L   " Open/close location list
]q / [q                 " Next/previous quickfix
]l / [l                 " Next/previous location list

" Window movement
<C-J>                   " Move to next window
<C-K>                   " Move to previous window
```

### Search & Navigation

```vim
" Enhanced search patterns (very magic mode)
<leader>/        " Search with \v (very magic)
<leader>?        " Reverse search with \v (very magic)

" Search control
<Esc><Esc>       " Clear search highlighting
n / N            " Next/previous search (auto-centered)
* / #            " Search word under cursor (auto-centered)
```

### LSP & Diagnostics

**Core LSP navigation** (buffer-local, only when LSP is attached):

```vim
gd               " Go to definition
gr               " Go to references
gi               " Go to implementation
gD               " Go to declaration
gy               " Go to type definition
K                " Hover documentation
<leader>cr       " Rename symbol
<leader>ca       " Code actions (normal and visual mode)
<leader>ck       " Signature help
```

**Diagnostic navigation** (buffer-local, following `]q`/`[q` pattern):

```vim
]d / [d          " Next/previous diagnostic
]D / [D          " Next/previous error (skips warnings)
```

**Diagnostic operations** (organized under `<leader>cd` for "code diagnostic"):

```vim
<leader>cdf      " Show diagnostic float (quick peek, auto-closes)
<leader>cdF      " Show diagnostic float (scrollable, focusable)
<leader>cdl      " Send buffer diagnostics to location list
<leader>cdq      " Send all diagnostics to quickfix list
<leader>cds      " Show diagnostic summary (error/warning/hint counts)
<leader>cdt      " Toggle virtual text diagnostics on/off
```

**LSP management** (always available):

```vim
<leader>cR       " Restart LSP client
<leader>cI       " Show LSP info
```

**Workspace management** (buffer-local, LSP-specific):

```vim
<leader>wa       " Add workspace folder
<leader>wr       " Remove workspace folder
<leader>wl       " List workspace folders
```

### Treesitter Features

**Text objects** (work with operators like `d`, `y`, `c`):

```vim
af / if          " Around/inside function
ac / ic          " Around/inside class
al / il          " Around/inside loop
aa / ia          " Around/inside parameter
```

**Movement**:

```vim
]f / [f          " Next/previous function start
]c / [c          " Next/previous class start
]F / [F          " Next/previous function end
]C / [C          " Next/previous class end
```

**Incremental selection** (for precise text selection):

```vim
gnn              " Start incremental selection
grn              " Increment to next node
grc              " Increment to scope
grm              " Decrement selection
```

### Nix Development Workflow

```vim
<leader>nr       " :NixRun (with prompt)
<leader>nb       " :NixBuild (with prompt)
<leader>ns       " Enter nix develop shell
<leader>nu       " Update flake.lock

  owner = "tpope";
  repo = "vim-commentary";
  rev = "b90f965880e761a026ae0c1e1d7174e65e4d7b45";  # Get with nix-prefetch-github
  sha256 = lib.fakeHash;  # Will be computed automatically
};
```

### Updating Plugins

# Get latest commit info
nix-prefetch-github tpope vim-surround

# Update plugins.nix with new rev and sha256
# Test the build
nix build .#neovim
```

## Architecture

### Three-Layer Approach

nvim-nix employs a three-layer architecture that leverages the strengths of
Nix, Vimscript, and Lua respectively. Each language does what it is good at and
no more:

#### Nix Layer (Infrastructure)

*"What should exist"*

- **Declarative Environment**: Packages, plugins, language servers, formatters
- **Reproducible Systems**: Identical setups across machines and time
- **Integration Logic**: Desktop entries, terminal detection, system configuration
- **Dependency Management**: All external tools with exact versions

```nix
# Nix handles: "Make these tools available"
languageServers = [ pkgs.pyright pkgs.rust-analyzer ];
plugins = [ vim-surround vim-fugitive ];
```

#### Vimscript Layer (Behavior)

*"How should Vim behave"*

- **Core Workflow**: Traditional Vim commands, mappings, patterns
- **User Interface**: Status line, quickfix integration, helper functions
- **Command Definitions**: All :commands and <leader> mappings
- **Editor Behavior**: Settings, autocommands, traditional vim features

```vim
" Vimscript handles: "How should the editor behave"
nnoremap <leader>fw :grep "" .<Left><Left><Left>
command! StripWhitespace call StripTrailingWhitespace()
```

#### Lua Layer (Modern Features)

*"How should modern features work"*

- **LSP Configuration**: Language server setup, capabilities, handlers
- **Dynamic Behavior**: Buffer-local keymaps that activate in response to LSP events
- **Modern APIs**: Diagnostic configuration, treesitter, floating windows
- **Event-Driven**: Autocommands that respond to LSP attachment

```lua
-- Lua handles: "How should modern features integrate"
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('LspAttach', {
  callback = function(event)
    vim.keymap.set('n', 'gd', vim.lsp.buf.definition, {buffer = event.buf})
  end,
})
```

#### Clean Boundaries

Each layer has clear responsibilities and interfaces:

- **Nix â†’ Lua**: Provides tools and generates configuration
- **Lua â†’ Vimscript**: Calls vim commands and integrates with existing patterns
- **No layer bypassing**: Each respects the others' domains

This architecture ensures that adding a language server happens in Nix,
defining key-mappings happens in Vimscript (with the exception of LSP
bindings), configuring LSP behavior happens in Lua. Each language does what it
is meant to do.

### File Structure

- `flake.nix` - Flake inputs/outputs with clean organization
- `plugins.nix` - Declarative plugin definitions with exact versions
- `lib/languages.nix` - Language support definitions
- `lib/plugin-management.nix` - Nix plugin utilities
- `lib/desktop.nix` - Desktop integration utilities
- `modules/` - Home Manager and NixOS integration modules
- `vimrc.vim` - Core vim configuration following traditional patterns

### Plugin Architecture

```
Plugins (8 total)
â”œâ”€â”€ Local Plugins (5) - plugins.nix
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vim-surround
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vim-vinegar
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vim-repeat
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vim-fugitive
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ vim-sexp
â””â”€â”€ Nixpkgs Plugins (3) - default.nix
    â”œâ”€â”€ nvim-lspconfig
    â”œâ”€â”€ nvim-treesitter
    â””â”€â”€ nvim-treesitter-textobjects
```

## Troubleshooting

### Formatters Not Available

**Problem**: Commands like `:!black %` fail with "command not found"

**Solution**: You're using the minimal variant. Use one of:
- `nix run github:mikabohinen/nvim-nix#dev` (app with tools)
- Install via Home Manager/NixOS modules with `enableDevTools = true`
- Use `nix develop` for development shell

### LSP Servers Not Found

**Problem**: LSP features not working

**Solution**: Ensure you're using the full package or have `enableDevTools = true` in modules

### Custom Configuration

Add custom config via Home Manager:

```nix
programs.nvimNix.extraConfig = ''
  -- Custom Lua configuration
  vim.opt.relativenumber = false
  vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>w', ':w<CR>')
'';
```

### Desktop Integration Issues

**Problem**: Desktop entries not appearing or wrong terminal used

**Solution**:
```nix
programs.nvimNix = {
  enable = true;
  terminalEmulator = "kitty";  # Force specific terminal
  installTerminalEmulator = true;
};
```

Check available terminals:
```bash
nix eval .#lib.versionInfo.available-terminals
```

### Plugin Management

**Problem**: Need to add, update, or remove plugins

**Solution**: Use built plugin tooling:

```bash
# List current plugins
nix run .#plugins list

# Check for updates
nix run .#plugins check-updates

# Get update instructions
nix run .#plugins update-info
```

Add plugins by editing `plugins.nix`:
```nix
new-plugin = {
  owner = "author";
  repo = "plugin-name";
  rev = "commit-hash";      # Get with nix-prefetch-github
  sha256 = lib.fakeHash;    # Auto-computed
};
```
